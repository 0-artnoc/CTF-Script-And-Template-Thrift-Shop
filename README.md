# CTF-Script-And-Template-Thrift-Shop

[115+ scripts]  There are a few genuine gems in there.   

And a lot of spaghetti code. Most of these scripts were for solving CTF's. If you googles something for a CTF and landed here look at the scripts they're all fairly malleable. Sorry  for the shitty naming conventions (not really). If you are a recruiter stop. I wont be able to rewrite half this shit in a formal interview ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
